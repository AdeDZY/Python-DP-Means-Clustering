Python-DP-Means-Clustering
==========================

DP-means K-means clustering algorithms comparison

"cluster.py" has implementations of k-means and dp-means clustering algorithms.

Implementations were intended to be straight-forward, understandable and give
full output for diagnostics, rather than optimized implmentations.

For more information on the dp-means, see Revisiting k-means: New Algorithms via Bayesian Nonparametrics
at http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0352/

SEE README for examples.
